To train a CNN network to learn the cars' poses on the image

# Problem
I want to know a car's pose on the road in real scene. After taking a photo of a car, I can use ssd, yolo or other methods to bound the car in the image, then the next step is to recognize its pose based on the crop image. Actually, I am not able to get a large amount of these images, unless I am a robot so that I can take photos day and night. A way to acquire enough images for training is to generate them with 3D model and virtual cameras. Then the next step is to build a deep network to train.
